# Project Name

Webpage about my time spent in Costa Rica as a volunteer.

The assignment is to creat a first website, trying to use what we have learnd so far (HTML and CSS basics).

## The problem

Since I did not have the intention to right a blog at all, my first problem was to find a suitable subject. Once I had an idea in mind, I made a sketch with pen and paper regarding my design and the content (headings). 
Based on this sketch, I tried to code. Whenever I got stuck, I googled for an answer and it actually worked. 

In a next step I would fill in the other menu tabs, but before doing so I would like my codes to be checked. The other tabs should look similar, however, I would include some videos and audio and a bunch of useful links. 

## View it live
